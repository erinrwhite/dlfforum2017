[Last year's keynote Stacie Williams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjo7D9vm9M8)

Ruth Kitchin Tillman: Grant-funded position guidelines that minimize harm to the person doing the work (term-limited positions)

Sandy Rodriguez: Shifting language around labor in the library, changing conversations with library administrators. Folx of color have another value placed on them in libraryland re: diversity work. Not permanent faculty status (contingent position) but administrator using her PoC status for library's advantage. Value of PoC labor / issues w/white ppl getting promoted over PoC. Need to shift relationship toward mutual accountability and reciprocity in employer/employee relationship.

Lisa Hinchliffe: how to help out students: give them space, professional connections, opportunities for meaningful work. 3 curriculum options in the LIS program - practicum, internship, LIS work. For non-credit work, MOU internship.

Graeme Slaght: copyright librarian, contingent laborer. Spending time working on faculty governance organization, policies for librarians. Changed names for visibility/status with faculty. Moving towards a faculty model could obscure work done by junior faculty i.e. managing time-bound projects, managing front desk operations, data ingest, scanning, other service-based work.

Emily Drabinski: faculty lockout at LIU will happen to you because capitalism! Lockout: no salary, no health insurance, no email. Capital wants labor, all workers have is labor to give. "It doesn't matter if you're right." What matters is power and organizing. Organizing is really quotidian work that we're all really skilled at.
