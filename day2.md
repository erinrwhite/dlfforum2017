Ruth Kitchin Tillman: Grant-funded position guidelines that minimize harm to the person doing the work (term-limited positions)

Sandy Rodriguez: Shifting language around labor in the library, changing conversations with library administrators. Folx of color have another value placed on them in libraryland re: diversity work. Not permanent faculty status (contingent position) but administrator using her PoC status for library's advantage. Value of PoC labor / issues w/white ppl getting promoted over PoC. Need to shift relationship toward mutual accountability and reciprocity in employer/employee relationship.

Lisa Hinchliffe: how to help out students: give them space, professional connections, opportunities for meaningful work. 3 curriculum options in the LIS program - practicum, internship, LIS work. For non-credit work, MOU internship.

Graeme Slaght: copyright librarian, contingent laborer. Spending time working on faculty governance organization, policies for librarians.
