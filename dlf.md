## preconference

"assume positive intent; own negative effects." - @aprilhathcock

### opening keynote: Loretta Parham, director of AUC Library - "Staffing of Our Digital Library: The Promise, the Plan and Our Response"

Lewis - The Expert Library

How to staff/train/offer services for Generation Z?
 - generation z is used to disruptive technology...anticipating, it's the norm
     + seven traits of Gen Z: phigital, hyper-custom, realistic, FOMO, weconomy, DIY, driven
     + they have never seen the government collaborate.
     + homeschooling has grown 60% in the past decade

Academic libraries of the future...
 - legacy print collections be gone
 - commit to special collections and local scholarship
 - connect with curriculum

The workforce - what about it
 - trends suggest more professional staff, fewer support and students; more professional staff with specialized skills, fewer generalists; more professional staff without MLS
 - in 2020...retirements
 - PAY staff and support staff development; support work/life balance; give meaningful work; give ongoing, continuous feedback
     + evaluations every 3 weeks / continuous feedback rather than annual process
     + what can we do in ADDITION to policy/procedure
 - pockets of knowledge may  not create diversity of knowledge in staff

#### lightning talk

It's about two decades into the new century and the world is in conflict. America is simmering with fear and uncertainty. 

A nationalist fervor is sweeping the country.

Immigrants are the scapegoats for fears around employment, public health, crime, language and culture.

People of one religion in particular are targeted for their efforts to "impose their religious laws" on America.

The dominant group asserts that their beliefs are being dismissed as "Intolerant". 

Conversations around race and nationality are contentious, with one group asserting that its members are the only "true Americans". 

A group of white people organizes in a grassroots fashion across the country, grows in popularity, and shows its force by marching by the thousands on Washington, D.C. 

The immigrants are from Europe, the religion is Catholicism, the group of white people is the Ku Klux Klan and the year is 1925.

### [funding opportunities](https://dlfforum2017.sched.com/event/BzsL/m4c-funding-possibilities-programs-priorities-and-trends?iframe=yes&w=100%&sidebar=no&bg=no#)

Themes: working with folks to hone applications, willing to accept drafts/revisions

**Lucy Barber, National Historical Publications and Records Commission**
Encourage draft applications. Looking at documenting the american experience. Spend time looking at the workplan, want something sensible. 

**Chris Barr, Director/ Media Innovation, Knight Foundation**
"Attention spans are different"/"we can be more mysterious". Working with libraries in 8 cities around the U.S. Often do challenges. Puts fundees through HCI training and wants to make a thing that people will use.

**Nicole Ferraiolo / Council on Library and Information Resources**
CLIR grants are narrow -
 - Recordings at risk - impact, urgency, viability of long-term preservation, cost-effectiveness
 - Hidden Collections program can be any format, no standards required. Evaluating proposals on scholarly impact, new knowledge in a variety of formats. Strong access component. Focus on preservation. Try to pull in many types of expertise from different types of folks. Standing review panels allow the panels to serve in advisory capacity.

**Patricia Hswe / Program Officer, The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation**
Working with NHPRC on digital edition grant

Invited proposals, iterative process; helping you hone proposal before it goes to board of trustees. Want to see engagement with the community; have you done a scan of others' work? Are you adding something new?

Proposals welcome, prospectuses; may fund a planning grant that turns into an implementation grant that turns into a business modeling/sustainability grant.

**Emily Reynolds, Institute of Museum and Library Services**
Deadline for two grants in september and february - overview of project and some forms. Those go through a round of peer review then invitations for full proposals. Then applicants put together full grant application which goes through another round of peer review. National leadership grant must have national impact for libraries, must identify partners. Sometimes cold-calling folks to apply for funding. Opportunities for folks to serve on review panels.

**Joel Wurl, National Endowment for the Humanities**
Almost all opportunities are open call; encourage draft applications as a way to help. Looking for connects with humanities to impress a peer review panel. Must meet an authentic need for an audience. Interested in more geographic diversity.
