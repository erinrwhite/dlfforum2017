Themes: working with folks to hone applications, willing to accept drafts/revisions

**Lucy Barber, National Historical Publications and Records Commission**
Encourage draft applications. Looking at documenting the american experience. Spend time looking at the workplan, want something sensible. 

**Chris Barr, Director/ Media Innovation, Knight Foundation**
"Attention spans are different"/"we can be more mysterious". Working with libraries in 8 cities around the U.S. Often do challenges. Puts fundees through HCI training and wants to make a thing that people will use. Looking at projects on the path to sustainability, business models for scaling.

**Nicole Ferraiolo / Council on Library and Information Resources**
CLIR grants are narrow -
 - Recordings at risk - impact, urgency, viability of long-term preservation, cost-effectiveness
 - Hidden Collections program can be any format, no standards required. Evaluating proposals on scholarly impact, new knowledge in a variety of formats. Strong access component. Focus on preservation. Try to pull in many types of expertise from different types of folks. Standing review panels allow the panels to serve in advisory capacity.

**Patricia Hswe / Program Officer, The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation**
Working with NHPRC on digital edition grant

Invited proposals, iterative process; helping you hone proposal before it goes to board of trustees. Want to see engagement with the community; have you done a scan of others' work? Are you adding something new?

Proposals welcome, prospectuses; may fund a planning grant that turns into an implementation grant that turns into a business modeling/sustainability grant.

**Emily Reynolds, Institute of Museum and Library Services**
Deadline for two grants in september and february - overview of project and some forms. Those go through a round of peer review then invitations for full proposals. Then applicants put together full grant application which goes through another round of peer review. National leadership grant must have national impact for libraries, must identify partners. Sometimes cold-calling folks to apply for funding. Opportunities for folks to serve on review panels. Generalize your work to broader landscape, look for collaborations and universal problems.

**Joel Wurl, National Endowment for the Humanities**
Almost all opportunities are open call; encourage draft applications as a way to help. Looking for connects with humanities to impress a peer review panel. Must meet an authentic need for an audience. Interested in more geographic diversity.

 - Why? Mental space; opportunity costs; portfolio balancing; outdated tech; 
 - Can be hard to see past past successes. Is it still worthwhile? Still working?
 - Memorial pages for sunsetted projects; possibility of turning something dynamic into something static
