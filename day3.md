## interface

**Survivor-centered approaches to design**. Michelle Caswell article in Archival Science. All records are human rights records. Turning interface design from universal to specific; prismatic interfaces, epistemic complexity and structural change (Duarte). Brenda Laurel defines interface as the contact surface of a thing. Jean Amery: "My skin surface shields me against the external world. If I am to have trust, I must feel on it only what I want to feel." In practice: from archives and digital collections. 
 - one interface has a browse view with inocuous images ...then an image of a patient being chained to a radiator
 - [archive of guatemalan national police abuse](http://ahpn.lib.utexas.edu) is presented as being really complex (provides 34-page user guide) "This is not a full-text search engine like google"
 - australian "find and connect" site designed for lay people, provides contact info for humans
 - "click here if you need to leave this site quickly" on domestic violence shelter websites or queer youth resource pages
 - tumblr tagging practices - xkit extension allows folks to create a blacklist of tags they don't want to see

How's it going? greater capacity, new expertise, more projects

Communicate often: internal folks want to understand where projects are in the queue; external folks want a menu of services

Benefits take time: invest first, payoff comes later; increased capacity comes with increased admin strain

Tools: org support; equipment and people; risk tolerance; project evaluation criteria
