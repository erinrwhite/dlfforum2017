How to staff/train/offer services for Generation Z?
 - generation z is used to disruptive technology...anticipating, it's the norm
     + seven traits of Gen Z: phigital, hyper-custom, realistic, FOMO, weconomy, DIY, driven
     + they have never seen the government collaborate.
     + homeschooling has grown 60% in the past decade

Academic libraries of the future...
 - legacy print collections be gone
 - commit to special collections and local scholarship
 - connect with curriculum

The workforce - what about it
 - trends suggest more professional staff, fewer support and students; more professional staff with specialized skills, fewer generalists; more professional staff without MLS
 - in 2020...retirements
 - PAY staff and support staff development; support work/life balance; give meaningful work; give ongoing, continuous feedback
     + evaluations every 3 weeks / continuous feedback rather than annual process
     + what can we do in ADDITION to policy/procedure
 - pockets of knowledge may  not create diversity of knowledge in staff

#### lightning talk

It's about two decades into the new century and the world is in conflict. America is simmering with fear and uncertainty. 

A nationalist fervor is sweeping the country.

Immigrants are the scapegoats for fears around employment, public health, crime, language and culture.

People of one religion in particular are targeted for their efforts to "impose their religious laws" on America.

The dominant group asserts that their beliefs are being dismissed as "Intolerant". 

Conversations around race and nationality are contentious, with one group asserting that its members are the only "true Americans". 

A group of white people organizes in a grassroots fashion across the country, grows in popularity, and shows its force by marching by the thousands on Washington, D.C. 

The immigrants are from Europe, the religion is Catholicism, the group of white people is the Ku Klux Klan and the year is 1925.
